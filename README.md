## Issue
**

**Please note that Instagram v167 has issues and should only be used for devices that are incompatible with Instagram v158.0, particulary iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max.**

With version 167, the user must log in again when the app is closed. **I recommend you log out and tap "Remember Login Info" to quickly log in the app.** 
This version also prevents the action blocked error some users had in the past.
